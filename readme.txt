Brew Tracker
Developer: Ryan Nix

'Brew Tracker' is a system that will run upon a raspberry pi with temperature (perhaps others) sensors. 
The system will gather data and present the data via a web accessable application that offers data analysis, data logging, and administrator settings for the system.
